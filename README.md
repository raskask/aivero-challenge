# Challenge the coder

## Programming exercise for software, robotics and machine vision engineer candidates at Aivero AS

### Task:
Write a RabbitMQ pubsub (publisher/subscriber) program that calculates the moving maximum (running maximum) over 100
samples in (soft) realtime of an incoming stream of signed 64-bit integers.
Publish your result after processing the incoming number and in addition forward the incoming number to the verifying node.

Add documentation and further adjustments as you see fit.

A rough guide to getting started can be found below.

Have fun, don't stress and good success :)

#### Requirements

* A docker-compose installation. Please see the [docker-compose installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for more information.
* A programming language with a RabbitMQ client (and preferably a JSON library as well). Please refer to the [RabbitMQ Client Libraries and Developer Tools](https://www.rabbitmq.com/devtools.html).

#### Steps:

1. Implement a small program with a RabbitMQ pubsub client. [Topics and message format](#topics-and-message-format)
describes the topics in use, and the message structure you're expected to use.
2. When you're ready to test your solution, spin up the `docker-compose`. Please see more instructions in [Testing your solution](#testing-your-solution).
3. Open the CSV file placed under *results/results.csv* and check that all fields in the rightmost column are `true`.
4. Send your solution to the maintainer

## Topics and message format

The `docker-compose` in this challenge hosts a RabbitMQ broker, a random number generator and a validator script. These
components use two different topics, that you're expected to consume from and publish to. They are, respectively:


### rand

`rand` - The random number generator publishes messages to this topic. You are expected to subscribe to and consume
these messages in your program. The messages are JSON formatted and contains a `sequence_number` and a `rand` field, like
so:

```json
{
  "sequence_number": 0,
  "rand": 25
}
```

### solution

`solution` - The validator consumes messages from this topic. You are expected to publish the your results on this
topic. The messages published to this topic must be JSON formatted and contain a `sequence_number`, `rand` and
`running_max` field. **You should not change the value of `sequence_number` and `rand` in your program.** Example message:

```json
{
  "sequence_number": 0,
  "rand": 25,
  "running_max": 12947712
}
```

## Testing you solution

When you're ready to test your solution, you should use the `docker-compose` provided in the repository. Please run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d # starts the docker-compose services and begins producing messages
# wait a second or two
docker-compose ps # ensure that the rabbitmq and validator services are "up". The number generator will terminate once it has produced its allocated number of messages.
docker-compose logs -f # Check if the rabbitmq broker is up and the other services have `CONNECTED`

# run your own solution - you'll know better what to do here (hopefully)
```

It is a good idea to stop the `docker-compose` when you have tested your script, as it will restart the containers on every boot of your machine.
Unless you specify a `NUMBER_OF_MESSAGES` environment variable in the docker-compose it will produce messages for ever.

Please do so by running:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Starting only RabbitMQ

In some cases it can be beneficial to only run RabbitMQ to test your connection. You may do so by running:

```bash
docker-compose up -d rabbitmq
```
